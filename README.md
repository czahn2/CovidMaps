This project aims to visualize Covid-19 case rates across United States counties. One map is a choropleth map and the other uses proportional symbols to visualize the data. 

In order to create these maps, I used Mapbox API. The COVID-19 case/death data I used is originally from The New York Times. The data include all the cases in 2020. The population data used for calculating the case rates are from the 2018 ACS 5 year estimates. Both data are at the county level. The U.S. county boundary shapefile was downloaded from the U.S. Census Bureau.

[Map 2 - Proportional Symbol](http://127.0.0.1:5500/CovidMaps/map5.html)


I used the map.on function in Javascript to load the map and provide functionality on click.
